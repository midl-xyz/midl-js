Please carefully read this Privacy Notice as it provides you with information about your personal data being processed in connection with your access to and use of the Platform. This Privacy Notice explains which types of personal data we hold on you, how we collect and process such data, how long we keep it, and so on. We handle your data in line with this Privacy Notice and strive to comply with applicable data protection laws.

Unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Notice, capitalised terms used in this Privacy Notice have the meaning determined in the MIDL Terms of Use (the “**Terms**”). You should read the Terms carefully as they affect your obligations and legal rights. In this Privacy Notice, “**personally identifiable information**”, “**personal data**”, and “**personal information**” are synonyms.

## **Contact Details**

We, MIDL LABS Inc, a company established under the laws of the State of Delaware, are a data controller (business) for the data collected under this Privacy Notice, meaning we determine how and why your data is processed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Notice or your data processing, please contact us at: \[email address\].

## **Our Principles**

While processing your personal data, we stick to the following principles:

### Lawfulness

We endeavor to process personal data in accordance with the applicable data protection laws and only on the basis of the appropriate legal grounds.

### Transparency

We endeavor to make the processing activities transparent and understandable for you, including by providing you with all reasonably necessary information regarding the processing.

### Purpose Limitation

We process your data only for the purposes it was collected. If we establish any other purpose, we will inform you reasonably in advance.

### Control

We try to give you as much control over your data as reasonably feasible, taking into account the available functionality.

### CIA Triad

We make efforts to comply with the best practices applicable to the development and maintenance of our security systems to ensure ongoing confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data.

### Disclosure Accountability

If we disclose personal data to any person, we will do our best to ensure that such person will comply with the terms of the applicable data protection laws and this Privacy Notice.

## **Type of Data**

The categories of personal data collected depend on how you interact with us, use the Platform, and the requirements of applicable laws. We collect and process the following types of personal data:

### Wallet Data

This includes Wallet addresses, which are public blockchain addresses associated with your Wallets, and associated transaction data, which may include information about transaction ID, amount, status, time and date, etc. While a Wallet address alone does not identify a specific individual, when combined with other data (such as a name, nickname or email address), it may enable identification. As a result, such combined data could be considered personal information. However, since we do not process any additional information, your Wallet Data is typically not personally identifiable for us.

### Analytical Data

This may include Internet protocol (IP) address, device details, operating system and browser information, session counts and other data regarding your use of and interactions with the Platform, collected automatically via cookies or similar technologies. The Analytical Data is collected via (i) Google Analytics, operated by Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates, including Google LLC (“**Google**”); and (ii) Vercel solution, operated by Vercel Inc. and its affiliates (“**Vercel**”). Google and Vercel gather information by means of cookies, which are, in effect, small data files placed on your device to recognize it during the Platform interactions or visits. They use unique identifiers and, in some cases, may qualify as personal data as they can uniquely identify a device’s user without revealing their real identity. With respect to Analytical Data, Google and Vercel act as our data processors. However, if they use this data for their own purposes, they act as independent data controllers, and we are not responsible for their actions. You can learn more about how they process personal data in their privacy policies: [Google’s privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Vercel’s privacy policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy).

### reCAPTCHA Data

This may include Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) data defining web page layout and design, installed plug-ins, JavaScript objects used for dynamic content, clicks and cursor movements, device or browser language, date, and time settings, as well as other hardware and software information. The reCAPTCHA Data is collected via reCAPTCHA solutions, operated by Google, which gathers information by means of cookies. Please note that we cannot identify you as a particular individual based solely on the information provided by Google. More information regarding reCAPTCHA solution is available [here](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha). With respect to the reCAPTCHA Data, Google acts as our data processor (service provider). However, if it uses this data for its own purposes, Google acts as an independent data controller (business), and we are not responsible for its actions.

### Marketing Data

This includes your email address. 

### Referral Data

This includes your referral link and code. When you participate in our referral program, we may assign you a unique referral code, made up of random letters and numbers, to identify you as a user sharing the referral link or code with others to use the Platform or join specific activities. Invited users also receive their own unique code for internal identification as referred users.

### Contact Data

This may include name, contact details (such as email address, Telegram and Discord account handles), social media (such as X (Twitter), Telegram channel), and other data, depending on what information you provide to us. Please do not provide personal data unless it is reasonably necessary or requested by us. Note that we may also collect certain other information, which may be required under the applicable laws.

### Communication Channels Data

When accessing or participating in our Communication Channels (e.g., X (Twitter), Discord, Telegram), you may provide personal data such as nicknames, names, photos, messages, comments, and other shared information. Additionally, the operators of the Communication Channels may automatically generate certain anonymised statistical and analytical data regarding the use of the Communication Channels. Under applicable laws, we may act as a data controller (business) or joint controller of this data. If we are deemed a joint controller, you may exercise your data protection rights with both us and the respective operator of the Communication Channel. However, we can only assist with processing operations explicitly covered in this Privacy Notice.

## **Processing Period**

As a general rule, your personal data is kept as long as it is necessary for the purposes it was collected. It may be retained longer if required to meet our legal obligations, in relation to legal proceedings, or to protect our rights and legitimate interests or those of third parties. The storage periods are as follows:

### Wallet Data

We do not set a retention period for the Wallet Data that is not personal, and we are not able to identify any particular individual with such Wallet Data. If the Wallet Data becomes identifiable, it will be retained for six (6) years after the completion of the transactions to which such data relates. Note that due to the nature of a blockchain, the Wallet Data may be stored permanently on the applicable blockchain, not by us, and may be accessed and viewed by any person at any time. For more details, refer to the ‘[Your Information and Blockchain](#your-information-and-blockchain)’ section of this Privacy Notice below.

### Analytical Usage Data

Technical Analytical Data, such as (IP) address, device details, operating system and browser information, is typically stored during the active user session or shortly after it ends. We do not set a retention period for the Analytical Data that does not allow us to identify any individual, such as aggregated analytical reports. If and to the extent we become able to identify any specific individual, we will update this Privacy Notice and set a specific processing period for this Analytical Data.

### reCAPTCHA Data

For up to six (6) months. Please note that Google may retain certain data longer than outlined herein. You can learn more about data use and retention periods in [Google’s privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/technologies/retention?hl=en).

As long as you remain a subscriber. You can unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time by (i) contacting us, or (ii) clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of each marketing email. Then your email address will be removed from our marketing database. Please note that administrative or service-related communications (like email verifications or maintenance notifications) are not considered marketing and may not include an unsubscribe option.

### Referral Data

As long as you use the Platform, and for six (6) years thereafter. 

### Contact Data

For six (6) years from the last date when you contacted us regarding the same matter. However, if our collaboration begins following your request, such as by entering into a contract, we will retain the data for the duration of the collaboration and for six (6) years after its conclusion, or longer if any outstanding obligations, including confidentiality obligations, remain.

### Communication Channels Data

We do not set retention periods for statistical and analytical data, as it does not allow for the identification of any individual. Any other data is stored as long as they are not deleted by either you or the respective operator of the Communication Channel.

## **Data Sharing**

### General

We do not sell or rent out your data. We may share it in line with this Privacy Notice, applicable laws, the Terms, or with your consent. Appropriate measures will be taken to protect your data during such transfers.

Please note that data that was put into a blockchain will be accessible to any person.

## **Your Information and Blockchain** {#your-information-and-blockchain}

Please kindly note that the Wallet Data interacts with a decentralised blockchain network: essentially, you enter this data to the blockchain using your Wallet each time you make a blockchain transaction or interact with blockchain smart-contracts. We do not control nor operate blockchain networks. This means that due to the structure of the blockchain network, certain rights or abilities may be limited. It also means that your Wallet Data is publicly available to any person who has access to the blockchain. Please be aware that any transaction within the blockchain network is irreversible and information put into the blockchain cannot be deleted or changed. The ultimate decision whether to transact on a blockchain or carry out any transactions rests with you.

## **Automated Decision-Making**

Automated decision-making is the process of making a decision by automated means without any human influence on the outcomes. We do not make any automated decisions based on your personal data. If we intend to process your personal data by any automated means, we will do our best to inform you about the same prior to such processing.

## **Data Subject Rights**

### Verification

In case you wish to exercise your data subject rights, we may request certain information from you to verify your identity and confirm that you are entitled to exercise such rights.

Please note that when interacting with blockchain networks, you may not be able to fully exercise certain rights under applicable data protection laws regarding your Wallet Data. For example, we may be unable to delete, correct, or restrict your Wallet Data.

## **Third-Party Services**

The Platform may provide access to or integrate with certain Third-Party Services, including Wallets, websites, decentralised applications, or plugins. These Third-Party Services act as independent data controllers in relation to your Personal Data, and your use of them is governed solely by their own terms and privacy policies.
