# React

MIDL.js provides React hooks for easy integration your React applications with the blockchain. 
The hooks are designed to be simple to use and provide a seamless experience for developers.

Under the hood the hooks use the `@midl-xyz/midl-js-core` for blockchain interactions
and [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v5)  to manage state and data fetching.
