### Modification

These Terms may be modified, supplemented, or updated from time to time without your consent or prior notice. In this case, the “Last Updated” date and version number at the top of these Terms will be updated accordingly. The updated Terms will automatically replace and supersede the previous version upon publication, taking immediate effect, unless we decide otherwise. By continuing to use the Platform, you confirm your acceptance of the updated Terms. It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly to stay informed of any changes.

### Interpretation {#introduction-interpretation}

Capitalised terms used herein and rules of interpretation are defined in Section 13 [Interpretation](#interpretation).

## **Platform and MIDL Materials**

### Functionality and Features

The functionality and features of the Platform are determined by us at our sole discretion, and may be described in the MIDL Materials or communicated by us or on our behalf via the Communication Channels. The availability of a particular feature does not imply our endorsement, recommendation, or solicitation to use or engage with it. Your use of and interaction with the Platform is entirely voluntary and at your sole discretion.

### Updates and Availability

The Platform and its components may be suspended, modified, or terminated at any time, with or without notice, and without liability. Access to the Platform may also be limited, suspended, or restricted with immediate effect and without notice and liability, regardless of reason, including due to maintenance, technical issues, Force Majeure Circumstances, or your violation of these Terms or laws. The Platform may integrate software, solutions, or tools to identify Prohibited Persons or users violating these Terms or laws. You must comply with all limitations outlined in these Terms and not attempt to circumvent or bypass them.

### Eligibility

To be eligible to access or use any functionality of the Platform, including to participate in the Activities, you must: (i) be legally capable of entering into a binding agreement; (ii) not be a Prohibited Person, nor act on its behalf; (iii) be at least 18 years old or of legal age (age of majority) in your jurisdiction; (iv) if acting on behalf of an entity, be duly authorised to do so and ensure that such entity is validly existing; and (v) fully comply with these Terms. If you do not satisfy these criteria, you are not permitted to access and use the Platform, including to participate in any Activities, until you do.

### Testnet

Some features of the Platform may be deployed and operated on a testnet, a development-stage environment provided solely for experimental and testing purposes. The testnet may be incomplete, unstable, contain errors or bugs, and may not function as described, intended, or expected. Its performance may materially differ from, and should not be relied upon as indicative of, the performance of any live blockchain main network. Furthermore, features available on the testnet may differ from, or may not be available on, the live blockchain main network. Any testnet assets, if available, may be used only within the testnet environment, have no monetary value, and do not represent real Virtual Assets or carry real-world utility. Such assets may be modified, revoked, or deleted at any time without notice. Any real Virtual Assets used within the testnet may be permanently lost, destroyed, or rendered inaccessible. By accessing or using the testnet, you expressly acknowledge and accept all associated risks, including, without limitation, the risk of total asset loss, malfunctions, interruptions, or unintended behaviour. We make no warranties, representations, or guarantees regarding the testnet and disclaim all liability for any loss, damage, or misuse related to your use of it.

### MIDL Materials 

All MIDL Materials are provided for informational and educational purposes only, and nothing contained therein constitutes a promise, warranty, or representation. There is no assurance that any MIDL Materials will be true, accurate, complete, timely or non-misleading, and we will be under no obligation to update or fix them. The MIDL Materials may contain opinions, forecasts, projections, future plans, or other statements about the Platform and our business activities, excluding statements of historical fact. These are considered forward-looking statements based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. There are no warranties that these statements will be accurate, and actual events, results, or outcomes may differ significantly. Reliance on the MIDL Materials, whether in whole or in part, and any use of them, is entirely at your own discretion and risk. Always verify that any information you believe to be from us is posted or communicated by our authorised representatives. 

## **Wallets**

### General

When using the Platform, you may connect your Wallet to it through one of the compatible third-party solutions, including software wallets. All Wallets or software wallets you use within the Platform are considered Third-Party Services, and we neither endorse nor shall be held liable or responsible in connection therewith. When using them, you should carefully review their applicable terms and policies. You may disconnect your Wallet from the Platform at any time.

### Security

Neither we nor the Platform have access to or control over your Wallets or Virtual Assets held in them. You must not share your Wallet credentials or allow others to access them. You are fully responsible for (i) securing your Virtual Assets, Wallets, and associated credentials; (iii) keeping your Wallet credentials confidential and ensuring their proper use; and (iv) all transactions made through your Wallets or using credentials thereto. 

### Release

We are not liable for any losses or damages, whether direct or indirect, resulting from the unauthorised use of your Wallets, unless such unauthorised use resulted directly and solely due to our negligence. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and forever discharge the MIDL Parties from any and all actions, claims, suits, demands, losses, damages, obligations, or liabilities of any kind, whether known or unknown, arising from or related to the above.

## **Activities and Rewards**

### Activities 

While interacting with the Platform, you can participate in certain Activities to accrue and receive certain Rewards. Any participation is completely voluntary and meant to provide an engaging experience, and build community around the project. It may not result in earning any Rewards, benefits or specific outcomes, including their conversion into any asset or currency. Even if you do earn any Rewards, there are no promises regarding their value, profitability, or usefulness. You must comply with all rules and limitations applicable to the Activities, and must not circumvent or bypass them, or attempt to do so.

### Rewards

Unless otherwise instructed by us, all Rewards are personal and non-transferable until received by you. If we determine so, certain Rewards may be permanently non-transferable, and we are not obligated to assign them any value, price, utility, or functionality. Rewards are not backed by any physical or financial asset, and may have no intrinsic or monetary value. Rewards neither entitle you to receive any return, passive income, interest, or other similar benefits, nor do they grant any ownership right or stake, security, share in revenue, intellectual property rights, or any other form of participation in or relating to us, Affiliates, or the Platform. 

### Parameters and Requirements

Any terms and parameters of Activities and Rewards, including their form, allocation, calculation, and eligibility criteria, are determined solely at our discretion. We reserve the right to change, adjust, or cancel any Activities, Rewards, their parameters, participation requirements or related features at any time, with or without notice, and without any liability to you, as well as restrict or terminate your participation in any Activities. To receive Rewards, you may need to meet specific requirements or conditions within a set timeframe, if applicable. Whether these requirements or conditions have been met will be determined by us at our sole discretion. Any such determination shall be final, with or without a notice to you, and cannot be disputed by you. 

### Distribution of Rewards

To receive Rewards, you must follow the instructions displayed on the Platform or as otherwise communicated by us. You acknowledge that Rewards may not be delivered immediately and may be provided on deferred terms. In some cases, you may need to manually claim Rewards as may be instructed via the Platform or otherwise by us, including from a properly configured interface or smart contract. Certain Rewards may have limited claim periods, and if you cannot be reached, are ineligible, or fail to claim or collect them within the specified timeframe, your right to receive those Rewards will automatically cease, and the Rewards may be forfeited. The MIDL Parties shall not be responsible or liable for your failure or inability to claim or withdraw any Rewards from a properly configured interface or smart contract, if applicable. Rewards may also be distributed to you directly through any method we deem appropriate. However, no Rewards will be distributed if doing so would violate any applicable laws, regulations, or government orders applicable to us, you, the Platform, or the respective Rewards.

### Violation

If we believe that you have violated these Terms while participating in the Activities, we may immediately suspend or terminate your participation in such Activities. We may also refuse to transfer any Rewards due to you and keep them as a part of our fair compensation for your violation.

## **Third-Party Services and Content**

### No Control or Supervision

When using the Platform, you may encounter and interact with the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services. Certain Third-Party Services may be developed by using or relying on the Public Materials. However, we do not own, operate, control, direct, or supervise these Third-Party Services, nor do we have any influence over their operators. No partnership, joint venture, or other similar relationship exists between us and any operator of the Third-Party Services. Any interaction, transaction, or engagement with the Third-Party Services and Third-Party Content is at your own risk and discretion, and all legal relationships and obligations occur and exist solely between you and the relevant operator. Any use of the Third-Party Services may be subject to documentation, terms, and agreements provided by their operators. We strongly encourage you to review such documents carefully before using or otherwise engaging with any Third-Party Services. 

### No Endorsements or Guarantees

We make no express or implied warranties regarding the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services, including their profitability, potential development, or long-term operation and maintenance. Nothing in these Terms, on the Platform, or in the MIDL Materials, including the fact that any Third-Party Services or Third-Party Content are displayed within the Platform, constitutes our endorsement or recommendation thereof, nor is it a solicitation to use or otherwise engage with them.

## **Intellectual Property**

### All Rights Reserved

Except as explicitly provided under these Terms or the applicable law, you do not gain any rights in or to the Intellectual Property, which remains fully owned by its respective rights holders, who may restrict its use at any time.

All rights not explicitly granted under the Licence or applicable FOSS Licences remain reserved by the respective rights holders.

### Licence

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are hereby granted the Licence. The Licence will remain effective until these Terms terminate or expire. Any use of the Platform not expressly permitted under the Licence is prohibited.

### Independent Decision-Making

You will carefully evaluate, check, and verify any content made available to you through the Platform, Communication Channels, or provided otherwise on our behalf, including MIDL Materials, before using or relying on it in any way. You will not base any decisions solely on such information.

## **Important Disclaimers** {#important-disclaimers}

### No Warranties

We make no express or implied warranties regarding the Platform and MIDL Materials, including any implied warranties of title, non-infringement, integration, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or warranties arising from any course of performance or usage of trade, all of which are expressly denied and disclaimed. Specifically, there is no warranty that: (i) the Platform and/or associated software will function as expected, work at all, or have any specific functionality; (ii) the Platform, and/or associated software will be secure, error-free, or available at any time or place, nor protected from hackers, malware, or other attacks; (iii) any bugs, vulnerabilities, security flaws, or other technical issues in the Platform, and/or associated software will be discovered or remedied, whether promptly or at all; and (iv) the Platform, Rewards and/or Activities will meet your expectations, serve a particular purpose, or be beneficial, profitable or suitable to you.

### No Advice

No part of these Terms, the Platform, and MIDL Materials, is intended to be, or should be considered, or construed as a business, legal, financial, virtual asset, investment, trading, or any other sort of advice, or advice of a professional advisor or broker regarding any matters to which all or any part of such information relates. Before making any decision, you should consult your own legal, financial, tax, or other professional advisors regarding any such information.

### No Custody

We do not provide nor intend to provide any custodial or similar services, custodial solutions or software, do not act as your agent or representative, and do not control, manage, or custody your Wallet connected to the Platform or any of your Virtual Assets.

### No Offer or Solicitation

No part of these Terms, Communication Channels, MIDL Materials, or the Platform constitutes (i) a prospectus, (ii) offer document, or (iii) an offer, recommendation, or solicitation to buy, sell, or hold investment instruments, securities, stocks, or Virtual Assets, in any jurisdiction.

### No Regulated Services

Nothing in these Terms, Communication Channels, MIDL Materials, or within the Platform shall be interpreted or considered as the provision of financial, virtual asset, legal, investment, tax, brokerage, financial advisory, fund management, or any related intermediation services. 

### No Benefits

Using the Platform and/or participating in any Activities does not presume any benefits, financial returns, gains, or positive outcomes. Any expectations of financial gain or other benefits are entirely your responsibility, and we are not liable for any losses or damages resulting from such expectations.

### No Fiduciary Relationship

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we owe no fiduciary duties to you under these Terms. However, we must act in accordance with these Terms and the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as required by law.

### No Partnership or Agency

These Terms do not create any agency relations, partnership, joint venture, or co-operative entity. We and you have no authority to bind each other or make public statements on each other’s behalf.

### Virtual Assets

In general, Virtual Assets are not backed by any physical assets and do not have any intrinsic value. Purchasing, using, holding, or otherwise transacting with Virtual Assets involves significant risks. There may be no liquidity or market for Virtual Assets at all, and they may become useless or abandoned entirely. The volatility and unpredictability of the value of Virtual Assets relative to the fiat currency, meaning the government-issued currency that is designated as legal tender through government decree, regulation, or the law, may result in significant or complete losses over a short period of time. Only allocate funds to Virtual Assets that you can afford to lose.

### Taxation

​​Any transactions involving Virtual Assets may have tax implications as imposed by state or government authorities. Tax laws for Virtual Assets may be unclear or not well-defined in your region. Additionally, these laws and their interpretations can change and may even be applied retroactively. You are solely responsible for understanding and meeting your tax obligations. Failure to properly report, collect, or pay applicable taxes could result in penalties, fines, or other legal consequences.

## **Limitation of Liability** {#limitation-of-liability}

### Damages

Except as excluded herein and subject to the liability cap outlined below, we are liable only for damages that directly arise from breach of our obligations under these Terms or applicable law. Additionally, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, the MIDL Parties shall not be liable for any consequential, incidental, indirect, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, business opportunities, data, goodwill, diminution of value, or business interruptions, regardless of their legal basis.

### No Personal Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event shall our or Affiliates’ officers, directors, employees, consultants, contractors, and shareholders be held personally liable in connection with these Terms, provided that the foregoing shall not limit our liability as an entity.

### Liability Cap

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the total liability of the MIDL Parties arising from these Terms, whether in contract, tort, breach of duty, or otherwise, including attorney’s fees, will not exceed one hundred (100) U.S. dollars or equivalent.

### No Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the MIDL Parties shall not be liable for any losses or damages, regardless of their legal basis (breach of warranty, contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort), even if advised of the possibility of such losses, arising from or caused by: (i) the Third-Party Services; (ii) the Platform users or any other third parties that are outside of our control; (iii) your breach of these Terms or applicable laws; and (iv) the Force Majeure Circumstances.

### Exclusions

Nothing in these Terms limits liability for gross negligence, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury resulting from negligence, or any other liability that cannot be legally limited.

## **Indemnification** {#indemnification}

To the fullest extent allowed by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the MIDL Parties from any claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from: (i) your violation of these Terms or applicable laws, including providing false representations or warranties; (ii) your participation in any Activities and use of the Platform; and (iii) your interaction with or use of any Third-Party Services. We reserve the right to control the defence of any indemnified claim, at your cost. This indemnity is in addition to any other legal remedies available to us.

## **Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution** {#applicable-law-and-dispute-resolution}

### Applicable Law

These Terms, as well as any relationship relating to the Platform, are governed by the laws of Delaware, excluding any conflict of law rules.

### Negotiations

You must first contact us to try to resolve any dispute related to these Terms or the Platform informally by sending a notice via email at \[email address for disputes\]. If no agreement is reached within thirty (30) days, the dispute may be submitted to arbitration as outlined below.

### Arbitration

If, and only if, a dispute cannot be resolved through the negotiations outlined in the preceding clause, then any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in Dover, Delaware before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures or JAMS International Arbitration Rules, depending on your location. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

### Opt-Out

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you have the right to opt out of the binding arbitration for disputes arising from or related to these Terms and any matters contemplated herein. To do so, you must send a written notice via email to \[email address for disputes\] within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name, residence address, email address, and an explicit, unequivocal statement that you are opting out of the settlement and resolution of disputes through binding arbitration. If you exercise your opt-out right within the specified timeframe, all other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and continue to apply to you. Exercising this right does not affect any future arbitration agreements that you and we may enter into separately.

### Court Proceedings

To the maximum extent permitted under the applicable laws, you and we hereby waive your and our respective rights to have any dispute arising from or related to these Terms and any matters contemplated herein resolved in a court, and to a jury trial. If, and only if, you opt out of the settlement and resolution of disputes in the binding arbitration as prescribed in these Terms, or a dispute cannot be resolved by the arbitration indicated in these Terms, whether under the law or arbitration rules, such dispute shall be finally settled by the courts of Dover, Delaware.

### Confidentiality

To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each party involved must maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration, litigation and negotiation proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the litigation or related to the disputes.

### No Class Actions

To the extent permissible by applicable law, any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and us and will be resolved solely through individual litigation, not as part of a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action or proceeding. You further agree to waive any right for such disputes to be brought or heard as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action or proceeding, to the extent permissible by applicable law. Combining or consolidating individual claims or litigations into a single litigation is not permitted without our prior consent.

### Statutes of Limitation

To the extent permitted by law, any claim related to these Terms and the Platform must be filed within one (1) year of the event giving rise to the claim. Claims not filed within this period will be permanently barred, meaning neither you nor we can pursue such claims.

## **Miscellaneous**

### Languages

The Platform, Communication Channels, and MIDL Materials may be available in multiple languages for user convenience. Translations into other languages may be generated manually or using automated translation tools. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or contextual reliability of any translated content. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between different language versions of the Platform, Communication Channels, or MIDL Materials, the English version shall prevail. We assume no liability for any misunderstandings, misinterpretations, or decisions made based on translated content. Only the English version of these Terms, the Platform, MIDL Materials, Communication Channels, and Communications is considered official. The English version shall prevail in case of differences in translation of these Terms, the Platform, MIDL Materials, Communication Channels, or Communications.

### Entire Agreement

These Terms and any incorporated documents constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding all prior and contemporaneous understandings, writings, or promises related to the subject matter of these Terms.

### Communications

We may send you Communications concerning these Terms and the Platform electronically, including via the Communication Channels. All such Communications will be deemed valid, in writing, and legally binding, and will be considered delivered to you on the day after they are published or transmitted. You can send us Communications to our contact email address \[email address for communications\].

### Third-Party Beneficiaries

These Terms will benefit the MIDL Parties, and any of them may rely on and enforce the provisions of these Terms as if they were a party to these Terms. Except in relation to the MIDL Parties, no person who is not a party to these Terms shall have any right to enforce any of its provisions or rely on any term hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modification, assignment, novation, or other amendment to these Terms may be made without the consent, approval, or notice of any third party, including any MIDL Parties.

### No Waiver

Our failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under these Terms or applicable law does not constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy. It also does not preclude or limit the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. Similarly, any single or partial exercise of a right or remedy does not preclude or limit its further exercise or the exercise of any other right or remedy.

### Assignability

You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may transfer or assign these Terms and our rights and obligations hereunder at any time without your consent.

### Validity and Enforceability

The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or part-provision of these Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provisions of these Terms, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

### Rules of Interpretation

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to one gender include all genders; singular includes plural and *vice versa*; terms like “including”, “in particular”, or “for example” are illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the following words; Section headings do not affect interpretation hereof; these Terms will not be construed to our disadvantage for preparing them. The terms “investment”, “investor”, “invest”, “returns”, “interest”, and other similar terms, as may be used within the Platform or in the MIDL Materials, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of decentralised smart contracts and the discretionary performance of traditional off-chain transactions.
