# calculateTransactionsCost

> **calculateTransactionsCost**(`totalGas`, `options`): `bigint`

Calculates the cost of a batch of transactions in satoshis, considering gas usage, fee rate, and transaction types.

The function uses internal constants and a script size map to determine the cost based on the transaction types. The formula includes gas price, script size, and asset-specific values, all converted to satoshis.

## Usage

```ts
import { calculateTransactionsCost } from '@midl/executor';

const cost = calculateTransactionsCost(1000000n, {
  feeRate: 2, // fee rate in satoshis per byte
  hasRunesDeposit: true,
  hasWithdraw: false,
  hasRunesWithdraw: false,
  assetsToWithdrawSize: 0,
});
```
